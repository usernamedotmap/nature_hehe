              <h1>Danakil Depression</h1>
              <p>
                The Danakil Depression formed from the continental drift of the
                African and Asian tectonic plates. As the plates drifted apart
                at a rate of 1-2 cm per year, they leave behind a geological
                depression, known as the Danakil Depression (or Afar
                Depression). The Danakil Depression sits at the triple junction
                between three tectonic plates. The Afar Depression spans
                Djibouti, Eritrea, and the Afar region of Ethiopia. The Northern
                part of this depression is the Danakil Depression, which sits
                more than 100m below sea level and contains some of the world’s
                most extraterrestrial landscapes. Beyond its fascinating
                geology, the Danakil holds the keys to some of biology’s most
                profound questions. In 1974, researchers found the remains of
                ‘Lucy’ in the Danakil Depression, an early ancestor of modern
                humans dating back 3.2 million years (now on display at the
                National Museum in Addis Ababa). The acidic springs of the
                Dallol Crater have attracted scientists in the search for
                extremophile microbes as they seek to understand the origins of
                life on Earth, as well as the possibilities for early-stage life
                on Mars.

              <h1>North Sea</h1>
              <p>
                Bermuda Triangle, section of the North Atlantic Ocean off North
                America in which more than 50 ships and 20 airplanes are said to
                have mysteriously disappeared. The area, whose boundaries are
                not universally agreed upon, has a triangular shape that reaches
                approximately from the Atlantic coast of Florida to Bermuda to
                the islands known as the Greater Antilles. Estimates of the
                Bermuda Triangle’s total area range between 500,000 and
                1,510,000 square miles (1,300,000 and 3,900,000 square
                kilometers). Reports of unexplained occurrences in the region
                date to the mid-19th century. Some ships were discovered
                completely abandoned for no apparent reason; others transmitted
                no distress signals and were never seen or heard from again.
                Aircraft have been reported and then vanished, and rescue
                missions are said to have vanished when flying in the area.
                However, wreckage has not been found, and some of the theories
                advanced to explain the repeated mysteries have been fanciful.

              <h1>St. George’s Church</h1>
              <p>
                Originally built in 1352, St. George’s Church (Kostel Svatého
                Jiří) in Luková has had quite the history. The church was nearly
                destroyed by fires many times over the centuries, and its roof
                partially collapsed during a funeral service in 1968. After that
                event, the congregation became convinced the church was haunted
                (we get it) and refused to enter; as a result, the building was
                stripped by robbers and fell prey to vandalism. That all changed
                in 2012, when an art student at the University of West Bohemia
                had an idea to draw visitors back to the church: a collection of
                30 ghost sculptures sitting in the pews with their heads bowed.
                Today, tourists have flocked to the “Ghost Church” to snap
                photos and even sit among the unmoving specters while praying
                (as of now, there are no signs of the installation being
                removed).

              <h1>The Island of the Dolls</h1>
              <p style="color: rgb(218, 211, 211)">
                Despite its status as a World Heritage site (along with Mexico
                City, it’s a well-preserved example of Aztec life), Xochimilco
                has reached a certain amount of internet fame for its Isla de
                las Munecas, or the Island of the Dolls. Hidden among the area’s
                many canals, the site is famous for the hundreds of dolls—and
                doll parts—hanging from trees and scattered among the grass.
                Although it looks more like a horror movie set than anything
                else, the chinampa (akin to an artificial island) used to be the
                actual residence of a now-deceased man named Julian Santa
                Barrera. After finding a dead girl’s body in a nearby canal,
                Barrera collected and displayed the toys in the hopes of warding
                off evil spirits. Daring souls can hire their own boat, try to
                convince the driver to pay the island a visit, and view it—along
                with the decaying house and dangling dolls—safely from the
                water.

              <h1>Blood Falls</h1>
              <p style="color: rgb(218, 211, 211)">
                Blood Falls, named for its ruddy color, is not in fact a gush of
                blood from some unseen wound. The color was initially chalked up
                to red algae, but a study in the Journal of Glaciology has
                uncovered its true origin using radar to scan the layers of ice
                from which the river pours. The discovery came at the hands of a
                team of scientists, including National Geographic emerging
                explorer Erin C Pettit. Located in Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry
                Valleys, the falls pour forth from Taylor Glacier, and the
                liquid bubbles up from fissures in the glacier’s surface. The
                flow was previously a mystery, as the mean temperature is 1.4
                degrees Fahrenheit (-17 degrees Celsius) and little glacial
                melting can be seen at the surface. Imaging from underneath the
                glacier helped solve the mystery, revealing a complex network of
                subglacial rivers and a subglacial lake—all filled with brine
                high in iron, giving the falls its reddish tint. According to
                the study, the makeup of the brine explains the fact that it
                flows instead of freezes. “The brine remains liquid within the
                subglacial and englacial environments through latent heat of
                freezing coupled with elevated salt content,” the study
                explains.

                Though Provence features a variety of stunning landscapes, few
                are as breathtaking as the Luberon Regional Natural Park in
                France. If you visit between the end of June and early August,
                you'll get to see (and smell) acres of blooming lavender plants.
                The herb's oil, which is known for its medicinal qualities, is
                pressed in local distilleries and workshops that welcome
                travelers, but for more insight about the plant, head to the
                Lavender Museum in the village of Cabrières-d'Avignon.

              <p style="color: rgb(218, 211, 211)">
                Stretching more than 6,500 miles, Salar de Uyuni is the largest
                salt flat in the world. Visit from December to April (the rainy
                season) for a phenomenon like no other: Due to a thin layer of
                water on top of the salt, Salar de Uyuni transforms into "The
                World's Largest Mirror," where the land and sky seemingly become
                one. Immerse yourself further into the salt flat by staying at a
                nearby salt hotel, where everything – including the walls,
                floors and beds – is constructed out of salt blocks. Plenty of
                other unique Bolivian landscapes can be found in the surrounding
                area of the flats as well, including Valle de Rocas, a valley
                filled with unusual rocks formations, and Sol de Mañana, a
                geothermal area that features erupting geysers.
